This project was implemented for EEE6225 System Design module in University of Sheffield 2018-2019 

Group members: Yuche Huang, Yukun Liu, Congbo Zhang, Jiahan Zhang

* This project is our implementation of low-area AES on FPGA

* The system is acheived by offering 572 slices and 55.59 Mbps

* The detial of the deisgn can be found in the [report](https://github.com/yuchehuang/Low-area-AES-on-FPGA/blob/master/Low%20area%20implementation%20of%20AES%20on%20FPGA.pdf)
